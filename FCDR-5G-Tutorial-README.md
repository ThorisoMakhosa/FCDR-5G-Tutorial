# FCDR-5G-Tutorial

## üéØ Purpose

This tutorial aims to help participants set up a **basic 5G standalone network** using emulated components:
- **OAI Core**
- **OAI gNB**
- **OAI UE**

All components are containerized using **Docker**, and **Wireshark** is used to monitor network traffic.

By the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:
- Launch a standalone 5G core network.
- Simulate gNB and UE behavior.
- Capture and analyze traffic using Wireshark.

   check container status:
   sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml ps -a
5. AMF logs
   ```bash
   sudo docker logs oai-amf -f
   
6. Run the gNB
   ```bash
    Sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-ran.yml up -d oai-gnb
AMF logs
    sudo docker logs oai-amf -f
gNB logs
    sudo docker logs oai-gnb -f
    
8.   Run the UE
    '''bash
      sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-ran.yml up -d oai-nr-ue
AMF logs
10. IP  address allocation check
     '''bash
        docker exec oai-nr-ue ifconfig
12. Traffic test
    '''bash
      docker exec -it oai-nr-ue bash
      ping -I oaitun_ue1 8.8.8.8 -c10

## üîß Key Components Overview

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **OAI Core** | Implements the 5G Core Network functions (AMF, SMF, UPF, etc.) |
| **OAI gNB** | Emulates the 5G base station |
| **OAI UE**  | Simulates a 5G User Equipment (UE) |
| **Wireshark** | Captures and analyzes packet traffic |

---

## üß™ What You'll Learn

- How to spin up a 5G network with emulated devices.
- Packet flows between UE, gNB, and Core.
- Basics of 5G architecture and its components.
- Using Wireshark to analyze signaling and data traffic.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Docker command errors?**  
  Ensure Docker is installed and the user is in the `docker` group.

- **Wireshark can't capture?**  
  Run it with `sudo` or give capture permissions.

- **VM won‚Äôt boot?**  
  Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS/UEFI.

- **Not enough RAM?**  
  Close other applications or use a machine with at least 8GB RAM.

## üìå Additional Notes

- The tutorial is best experienced with **VMware Workstation** due to compatibility and performance.
- Pre-workshop setup is **mandatory**. Make sure your environment is running before the session.
